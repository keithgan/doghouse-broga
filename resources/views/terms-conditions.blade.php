        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Check-in & Check-out</h2>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2" start="19">
            <li>Our business hours are 9am – 6pm Monday to Saturday. All check-ins must be before 6pm. We prefer check-in before 4pm so that the evening feeding session (which starts from about 5pm) is not interrupted and dogs that are already in their housing are not disturbed. Also this allows your pet time to settle into their new surrounds before it gets dark. Our advice is to arrive early in the day if possible. This enables your pet maximum time to settle into the retreat environment.</li>
            <li>We operate like a hotel. If you are late to pick up and vacate your space, you will be charged for the extra day.</li>
